# Java-Image-Editor
This Java Image Editor project was developed as part of the curriculum at Scaler School of Technology, representing the first project that we made. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for performing various image manipulation tasks, including gray-scale conversion, flipping, rotation, brightness adjustment, and image blurring.
